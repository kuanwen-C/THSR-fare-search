# THSR-fare-search
Using python and Flet to create a program to search THSR ticket price.

The program can read data from an Excel file using Pandas and use the NumPy package to arrange the data into matrices. It uses the Python package "Flet" to create a GUI interface that allows the user to input the route. The program then calculates the ticket fare and returns it.

(#note. please ut the csv file under the same directory of the python file )
